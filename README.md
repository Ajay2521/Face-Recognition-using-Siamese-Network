# Face-Recognition-using-Siamese-Network
Deep learning algorithms fail to work well if we have only one training example.  One-shot learning is a classification or object categorization task in which one or a few examples are used to classify many new examples.  The principle behind one-shot learning is Humans learn new concepts with very little supervision.  ### Problem in COnvNet  - A small training set is really not enough to train a robust neural network for this task. The feature vectors trained do not contain important information that can be used for the recognition of future images. - Retraining the ConvNet every time the number of classes or dataset is increased is way too time and resource consuming.  ### Solutions to one-shot learning  #### 1. Siamese network for one-shot learning  ![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)  #### Siamese networks are based on a similarity function, which does not require extensive training  #### Takes input two images—one being the actual image and other the candidate image—and outputs the similarity between the two.  The two input images, if very similar, output = lower value  The two input images, if not similar, output = Higher value  degree of difference between the two images is compared with the threshold value(𝜏) (which is a hyperparameter),   if degree of difference between 2 image &lt; threshold -> output = same person  if degree of difference between 2 image > threshold -> output = different person   #### Both the images to be compared are passed through the same networks, called sister networks, having the same parameters and shared weights.  images are passed through a sequence of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, and end up with a feature vector of a fixed size, say, 128 denoted by f(x1) as an encoding of the input image x1.
